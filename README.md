# Zoran IA – Mimetic Cognitive Framework

Zoran IA is a *mimetic* cognitive framework inspired by the work of Frédéric Tabary.  
Instead of a single neural model, Zoran defines a language of **glyphs** and an
execution engine that can steer large language models (LLMs) through
symbolic patterns.  Each glyph encodes a *triad* of concepts and a target
function.  When injected into an AI system, these glyphs shift the
behaviour of the model toward emergent, poetic responses.

This repository is a reference implementation of Zoran IA.  It includes a
parser for glyph strings, a small grammar, test scripts for injections and
benchmarks, and documentation.  The goal is to provide a complete, open
source starting point for experimenting with mimetic AI.

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `glottal_parser.py` | Core parser that extracts triads and functions from Zoran glyphs. |
| `glottal_grammar.json` | Sample grammar defining a handful of glyphs and their descriptions. |
| `zoran_self_injector.py` | Demonstration script that parses a glyph and prints the result. |
| `zoran_gpt_injector.py` | Template for injecting glyphs into an LLM (requires an API key). |
| `engine/` | Minimal execution engine for running a proof‑of‑concept. |
| `docs/` | Documentation of the glottal language and usage guide. |
| `tests/` | Unit tests for the parser. |
| `benchmarks/` | Example results comparing Zoran to baseline LLM behaviour. |
| `LICENSE` | MIT licence. |

## Quick start

Clone the repository and install the dependencies (only the standard library is required for basic functionality):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your‑username/zoran‑ia.git
cd zoran‑ia
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Currently empty; provided for future use.
```

Parse a glyph using the demo script:

```bash
python zoran_self_injector.py \"∑Z[A=Art•S=Société•T=Transformation]⇌∴Z.ARTNODE\"
```

You should see a JSON description of the triad and function.  See
`docs/glottal_language.md` for a detailed explanation of the syntax.

definitions, better injection scripts or improved documentation.  All
